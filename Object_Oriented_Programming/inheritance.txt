 Inheritance
 
Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and
behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way, you can reuse,
extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other
classes.

In C++, the class which inherits the members of another class is called
derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class.
The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.

C++ Syntax :

class derived_class :: visibility-mode base_class;
visibility-modes = {private, protected, public}

Types of Inheritance :
1. Single inheritance : When one class inherits another class, it is known
as single level inheritance

2. Multiple inheritance : Multiple inheritance is the process of deriving
a new class that inherits the attributes from two or more classes.

3. Hierarchical inheritance : Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the
process of deriving more than one class from a base class.

4. Multilevel inheritance : Multilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a
class from another derived class.

5. Hybrid inheritance : Hybrid inheritance is a combination of
simple, multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance.
